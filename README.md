express server hosting fizzbo.com
9/26:

Initial commit.  Just getting a basic express server capable of hitting a 'hello world' route scaffolded and running before I commit to an approach. 
I need to talk to a dev more experienced with IDX, RETS feeds, XML, NodeJS, and GraphQL before I make any serious commitments.
